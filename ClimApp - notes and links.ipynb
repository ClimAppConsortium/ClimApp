    "* More than 200 people will be a part of beta testing the app. \n",
    "* The app should be implemented on both Android and iOS, starting with Android as they have the largest market share and cover a low-income-users which probably will have an Android device.\n",

    "#### *General criterias for the app*\n",
    "* Fetch data from German weather stations, 4 parameters: humidity, temperature, CO2 + one more. \n",

    "* Incorporate an architecture that allows for saving of user data + logging of chosen attire for \"cold\" and \"warm\" weather.\n",
    "* Calculations for the individual user should be performed based on all user input.\n",
    "* The calculations should make it possible to suggest a change in user behaviour, adaption stragtegies (change of attire, drink more water etc.)\n",
    "* Notifications should appear if sudden change in climate both on daily and over a period of time. Notifications will in the beginning only be on a day-to-day forecasting basis giving the user information in the morning before leaving for work, later on the user should be able to set this in his/her settings.\n",
