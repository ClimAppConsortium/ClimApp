# ClimApp - *climate information personalized* 

This is the codebase for the prototype and final app developed as a part of the ERA4CS ClimApp project. As the app is being developed the readme will be updated with necessary information.

Follow the app development (with some delay) in this interactive screen visualization: [https://invis.io/W3EQCCGSN](https://invis.io/W3EQCCGSN)

Note! Not all functionality is made available in the app, furthermore, the commits to the github prototype codebase will not be 1:1 with Invision App.

## Requirements and installation
The scripts in Jupyter Notebooks require an installation of Python 2.7.

For all Java code you need to install [Java](https://java.com/en/download/) and [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/install.html) including different SDKs/JDKs and JRE. 

For the best simulation of the app, use USB Debugging on your device (Developer mode).
